    <h1>From Garden To Plate</h1>
    <p>A <em>potager</em> is a french term for an omamental vegetable or kitchen garden.
        Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance
        the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food
        aesthetically pleasing.</p>
    <h4>What to Plant</h4>
    <p>Plants are choosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form.
        Many are trained to upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut flower and
        herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potager can disguise their function
        of providing for a home in a wide array of forms-from the care free style
        of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.
