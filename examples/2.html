    <h1>The Story in the book.</h1>
    <h4>Chapter 1</h4>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
        On her desk, laying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em> 
        and all the other
        scientific journals her work had appeaed in, was a well thumed copy of <em>On The Road</em>.
        It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she
        spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. </br>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster
        with an Oscar wilde quote proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better
        to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the
        Ilama DNA, to be an outstanding achivements, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something
        better to do. </p>
